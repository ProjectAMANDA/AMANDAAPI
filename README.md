## Overview
-----
The custom API will handle the calls to the Azure language analysis API that will return the sentiment and key words of a blog post. It will also store a series of sanitized images that can be used to match both keywords and sentiment of the blog posts from the web app. The custom API can be scaled to utilize the Bing search API to return a series of more random but possible less safe images. These images can be used with the set already stored to provider a wider range of matches for blog posts.
